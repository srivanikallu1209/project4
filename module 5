Sales & Order Module
This module often integrates with Inventory and Accounting via Domain Events to keep them decoupled.
@Service
public class SalesService {
    @Autowired private ApplicationEventPublisher eventPublisher;

    @Transactional
    public Order placeOrder(OrderRequest request) {
        Order order = saveOrder(request);
        
        // Decoupled communication: Inventory listens to this to reduce stock
        eventPublisher.publishEvent(new OrderPlacedEvent(order.getId(), order.getItems()));
        
        return order;
    }
}
